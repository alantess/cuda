# Convolutional 1d

INPUT = [1,2,1,1,1]

TRUE ARRAY AKA MASK [1,2,3]


USE THE MASK AND INPUT TO CREATE AN OUTPUT ARRAY [  ]

Calculation

Input
   1  2  1  1  1  
1  2   3  <--- Mask 


0x1 + 1*2 + 2*3 = 6 = output[0] 

New Exmaple

input [1,1,1,1,1]
mask [1,2,3]

output [5,6...] 

Parallelism 
1 thread for each value in the result
N threads = size of output []


## Constant Memory 
---------------------
<p>Memory that doesn't change at all. It gets put into constant cache. So in this instance the 
mask would go into the constant cache </p>
